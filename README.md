Hidden Behaviors of Mobile Applications Detected Using Appium:

Mobile applications have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering a wide range of functionalities and services. However, ensuring the reliability and security of these applications remains a significant challenge.
The research discusses the use of Appium, an open-source automation tool, to uncover hidden behaviors within mobile applications. Appium provides a versatile framework for testing mobile applications across various platforms, enabling testers and developers to examine app behaviors beyond what is visible to the end user. Through Appium, we can detect and analyze hidden behaviors such as network requests, API calls, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities. By automating the interaction with mobile apps, Appium allows for the exploration of both expected and unexpected app behaviors, enhancing the quality assurance process.
